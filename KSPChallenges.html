  <h1><i>Kerbal Space Program</i> Main Challenges</h1>
  <p>While there are many challenges in the Space Race, there are a few major challenges that everyone should attempt:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Orbit Kerbin.</b> Using only basic parts, get a manned space craft into a circular orbit of 100km and return the pilot safely.</li>
    <li><b>Basic Mun Landing.</b> Land a manned craft safely on the Mun, plant a flag, and return the pilot home safely.</li>
    <li><b>Duna Rover Landing.</b> Design an unmanned rover, transport it and land it safely on Duna then drive it around.</li>
  </ul>
  <p> There are also some historical challenges where you can try to recreate actual missions that happened.</p>
    
  <ul>  
    <li><b>Apollo Style Mun Landing.</b> Create an Apollo style craft and complete and Apollo style mission. This means to have a separate Command Module (CM) and Landing Module (LM). The CM will hold the three astronauts going on the mission during launch and work to shuttle the LM to the Mun. At the Mun, two astronauts will board the LM which will then separate from the CM (leaving it and one astronaut in orbit around the Mun) and land on the Mun. After a brief Mun walk, the two astronauts on the Mun will return to the LM, launch into Mun orbit then rendezvous with the CM and dock with it. The rejoined craft will then use the rockets on the CM to return back to Kerbin where the command pod will separate and return to the surface safely with all three astronauts.</li>
    <li><b>Apollo 13.</b> After completing the <i>Apollo Style Mun Landing</i>, fly a new copy of the ship used in that challenge without modification. After doing the burn to reach the Mun, disable the main engine on the CM. Return all three Kernals safely back to Kerbin without reactivating the engine.</li>
    <li><b>Space Shuttle.</b> The Space Shuttle is a truly absurd space craft that should not have worked. Design your own Space Shuttle, use it to carry a small, unmanned satellite into low orbit, then return safely by gliding back and landing on the Space Center runway.</li>
  </ul>
