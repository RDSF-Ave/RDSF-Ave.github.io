<h1>Real Science Challenges</h1>
  <p class="st"><a href="index.html">Go Back</a></p>
  <p>Here you can find the assignment docs for the Real Science Challenges. Each week you will need to do some amount of work with the actual science. When you finish, you can submit your work through <a href="https://forms.gle/fVrjaU3Zx1bnVoAu8"><b>this Google Form</b></a>.
 
  <h2><a href="pdfs/Week1Orbits.pdf">Week 1: Orbits</a></h2>
  <p>Dig into the science of orbits. Specifically Kepler's formulation which gives them shape and allows us to examine the features of an orbit along with some of the dynamics of orbits. There are different sections with different difficulties and types of work. You need to complete at least one section, but exploring multiple section will give you a good challenge and a more complete understanding. If you are going to go for the "Beyond Kepler" section, you must first complete the "Level 2" science portion.</p>
 
  <h2><a href="pdfs/Week2RE.pdf">Week 2: The Rocket Equation</a></h2>
  <p>Orbits tell us how rockets move, but don't really tell us how to make rockets. The Rocket Equation relates the design of a rocket to what it can do. So if we know the orbits we will need to get to, then we can work to design a rocket that can get there.</p>
