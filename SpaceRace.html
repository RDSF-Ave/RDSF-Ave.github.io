<h1>Space Race</h1>
  <p class="st"><a href="index.html">Go Back</a></p>
  
  <p>The Milestone Challenges are key objectives to accomplish, but there are many, many, many other challenges that KSP offers. Moreover, it is unlikely that you will be able to just go through and accomplish the Milestones, some learning will need to be done along the way and the best way to do that is trying other challenges. And so we have the Space Race. During the Cold War, the US and the USSR engaged in an arms race which manifest through creating robust space programs, with each country trying to out-do the other. In the end, the USSR accomplished more firsts, but the US landed on the moon first - one of the major milestones.</p>
  <p>We will be having our own Space Race! There are many challenges listed here, some are fairly simple, some require learning some valuable skills, and others are extra tough. It may be advantageous to try some as soon as possible, and others might be better left until after you unlock more technology - the choice is up to you. After accomplishing a Space Race Objective, complete a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d41jChheqvsF1CLutxDIIENd8e4Xwzddh9ul9xwoy_g/copy">Mission Report</a> and submit it through the associated <a href="https://forms.gle/oDQ28EX54KxN7WkM9">Google Form</a>. If you are the first to complete and submit the mission, then you will be spotlighted and your mission will be given its own page to show off. Even if you are not the first to complete an objective, you can still complete them and submit your Mission Reports and your accomplishment will be logged on the site as well. Some of the objectives are Milestones, they are still part of the race and are identified for convenience.</p>
  <h2>Space Race Objectives</h2>
  <p>Note: Each mission can only accomplish ONE objective at a time! Additionally, no one-way-trips for pilots, all astronauts must return safely.</p>
  
  <h3>First Steps</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Launch-and-Land (Milestone):</b> Successfully launch a manned rocket, land it safely, and recover the totally fine pilot.</li>
    <li><b>Land on the Abandonded Airstrip:</a></b> There is an abandoned airport on an island near the Kerbal Space Center. Land a vehicle at this airport and plant a flag.</li>
    <li><b>Fly and Land an Airplane:</a></b> Build an aiplane in the Spaceplane Hanger. Successfully fly and land it on an airstrip.</li>
    <li><b>Sub-Orbital Flight:</a></b> Enter a trajectory which leaves the atmosphere (over 70km), but returns to the planet without orbiting.</li>
<li><b>Sub-Orbital Spacewalk:</a></b> While on a sub-orbital trajectory, engage in a spacewalk totally disconnected from the spaceship.</li>
<li><b>North Pole Sub-Orbital Flight:</a></b> Fly to and land at the North Pole using a sub-orbital trajectory.</li>
<li><b>North Pole Airplane Flight:</a></b> Construct a spaceplane to fly to, and safely land at, the North Pole.</li>
<li><b>Plant a Flag on the VAB:</a></b> Create a craft to fly an pilot to the top of the VAB and plant a flag there.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Flying is just falling, the trick is to miss the ground</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Enter a stable orbit (Milestone):</b> Achieve an orbit of altitude 100km, complete at least one revolution, and return to the planet.</li>
    <li><b>Land at KSC from Orbit:</a></b> Achieve an orbit of altitude 100km, complete at least one revolution, and then return to the planet and land back at KSC</li>
    <li><b>Polar Orbit:</a></b> Achieve a polar orbit - an orbit which passess over the poles - of altitude 100km.</li>
    <li><b>Geosynchronous Orbit:</a></b> Achieve a Geosynchronous Orbit - an orbit which rotate with the planet and so stays over the same spot on the planet. This can be an unmanned satellite which does not return.</li>
<li><b>Geosynchronous Orbit over KSC:</a></b> Achieve a Geosynchronous Orbit directly above the KSC. This can be an unmanned satellite which does not return.</li>
<li><b>Fleet of Geosynchronous Satellites:</a></b> Create and launch three identical satellites and place them all in geosynchronous orbit in an equidistributed pattern.</li>
    <li><b>Spaceplane Orbit:</a></b> Create and fly a spaceplane into orbit. Complete at least one full orbit. Then safely return to the planet and land on the airstrip at KSC.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Living in Space</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Rendezvous:</b> Create and launch two identical manned ships. First put one in low orbit (100km). Then launch the second one and have it rendezvous with the first. No docking, they should fly right next to each other (within 20 meters) for at leats one complete orbit. While rendezvoused, have the pilots swap crafts. Then safely land each back on the planet. </li>
    <li><b>Rescue:</b> Create and launch a manned rocket into low orbit (100km). Simulate a disaster by permanently shutting off all engines and maneuvering thrusters so that it is stuck and cannot move anymore. Rescue the pilot by creating a rescue ship with an extra seat, rendezvousing with the damaged ship, transferring the pilot, and returning them safely to the planet. </li>
    <li><b>Docking:</a></b> Create and launch two identical, manned or unmanned, ships which have docking capabilities. Launch the first and put it into low orbit (100km). Launch the second, bring it to orbit, and then dock it with the first - combining them into a single ship in space. </li>
    <li><b>Efficient Docking:</a></b> Do the previous challenge, but complete the docking procedure before the second ship completes 2 whole orbits.</li>
    <li><b>Small Space Station:</a></b> Construct a habitable, self-sustaining module. Launch it, park it into low orbit (100km). Leave one pilot on the module and return the lauch craft back to the planet.</li>
    <li><b>Medium Space Station:</a></b> Create a space station with two seperate habitable modules, launched on two separate missions. Populate it with two permanent astronauts.</li>
    <li><b>Large Space Station:</a></b> Create a space station with five seperate habitable modules and one separate science module. Populate it with four permanent astronauts.</li>
<li><b>Deliver Payload to Space Station using a Space Plane:</a></b> Create a small module, and load it into a cargo bay on a space plane. Launch the space plane into orbit and have it dock with a space station. Add the delivered module to the space station through the docking, and then safely fly the space plane back to the planet, landing at KSC.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>It is only a digital Mun</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Crash into the Mun:</b> Create an unmanned craft and crash it into the Mun.</li>
    <li><b>Orbit the Mun:</a></b> Create an unmanned craft, fly it to and enter orbit around the Mun. Leave it in low Mun orbit (10km).</li>
    <li><b>Unmanned Mun Landing:</a></b> Create an unmanned craft, fly it to the Mun and enter orbit. Then safely land the craft on the Mun.</li>
    <li><b>Mun Landing (Milestone):</a></b> Create a spacecraft to fly an astronaut to the Mun and land safely on it. Plant a flag on the Mun. Then use the spacecraft to safely return the pilot back to the planet.</li>
<li><b>Mun Rover:</a></b> Create an unmanned rover, deliver it to the Mun, and drive it around.</li>
<li><b>Mun Vehicle:</a></b> Create a manned rover, fly it to the Mun and have a kerbol drive it around. Return the pilot home safely.</li>
<li><b>Spaceplane Mun Landing:</a></b> Create and fly a spaceplane to the Mun and safely land on the Mun. Plant a flag. Use the space plane to safely return and land back on the planet, landing on the airstrip at KSC.</li>
<li><b>Small Mun Base:</a></b> Construct a habitable, self-sustaining module. Launch it and land it on the Mun. Leave one permanent resident on the Mun and return the lauch craft back to the planet. </li>
<li><b>Medium Mun Base:</a></b> Create a Mun base with two seperate habitable modules, launched on two separate missions. Populate it with two permanent astronauts.</li>
<li><b>Large Mun Base:</a></b> Create a Mun with three seperate habitable modules, one separate science module, and a drivable Mun vehicle. Populate it with three permanent astronauts.</li>
<li><b>Apollo Style Mun Landing:</a></b> Create a space station with five seperate habitable modules and one separate science module. Populate it with four permanent astronauts.</li>
  </ul>
