<h1>Daily Activities</h1>
  <p class="st"><a href="index.html">Go Back</a></p>
  <p>Each day, certain things will be expected of you to keep you engaged and to give you a chance to share your learning. Of key importance is showing up for any and all class meeting when able. Check you calendar! In addition:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Join:</b> Be sure to join and take part in any class meetings and discussions we have. Check your calendar!</li>
    <li><b>Work:</b> There are two main work periods in the day, before and after lunch. Use this time to do your work! And if you have any questions, this is a time to ask your fellow students, or Mr. Wiese and Mr. Tappe for advice. You also have an hours worth of homework time to continue engaging with your work later in the evening. </li>
    <li><b>Share-Out:</b> Post a screenshot of a moment which helped define your day to our board and write a little reflection summar. It can be a success or something that kept going utterly wrong, or anything in between. It can be from KSP or a picture of some of the more technical science you do. Then explain what the picture represents, along with some of the troubles, successess, insights, and frustrations that went along with it. Use it to explain what you learned today!</li>
    <li><b>Comment:</b> Read through some of your classmates' posts and comment. Give some advice, offer to brainstorm together about their issue, ask to talk with them about it to learn more, or even use it to make a not-mean joke/meme! Your peers are where you will get the most genuine learning experiences, so connect!</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h1>Recurring Activities</h1>
  <p>When we talk about "Work", what does that mean in a class built around a video game? Here are the different things that you need to work on in order to complete the course:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b><a href="milestones.html">Milestone Missions:</a></b> There are some fixed objectives that are required for everyone, these are the Milestone Objectives and completing them gives access to more powerful technology. If you're unsure about what to do, then work towards completing the next milestone.</li>
    <li><b><a href="spacerace.html">Space Race:</a></b> In addition to the required Milestone Missions, there are a ton of optional objective to reach. These are found in the Space Race and if you are the first to successfully execute one of these missions, then your name and mission will be highlighted on the website. Who can get the most objectives? Who can complete the most difficult objectives?</li>
    <li><b>Mission Reports:</b> A Mission Report is a report of a completed mission. These reports explain what the objective was, what happened during the mission, and some analysis to help make the next mission go smoother. Each Milestone and Space Race objective completed will require a Mission Report to be submitted.</li>
    <li><b>Real Science and Math:</b> Working with the game can help develop your intuition and problem solving with rockets, but working with real science and math can help you understand the concepts and plan more effective missions. Each week, there will be some science-based focus with quantitative work to go along with it. Take time to work on it, share it with your classmates, and ask questions to help your understand better! The balance between KSP, science, and any other activities will generally be up to you, but you will need to do a base amount of each.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h1>Showcase</h1>
  <p>At the end of Fifth Term there is the Student Showcase, where students share with each other, with their teachers, with their parents, and with many others what they have accomplished. This year, students will create a 2-3 minute video to present their work and final products. During the course of Fifth Term, you need to keep in mind that you will be showcasing your work and a final project and work towards it. Here as some options for a final project:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Minute Physics Explainer:</b> Inspired by the YouTube Channel "Minute Physics", create a short video which explains a complicated idea about Rocket Science or Space Flight in an intuitive way!</li>
    <li><b>Realistic Mission:</b> In real life missions, we don't whing it much at all. There is a lot of planning and analysis which goes into a real mission. Plan a realistic mission using the various planning tools that KSP has, construct an optimal ship that has the least amount on it needed to complete the mission. Execute the mission, taking data and logs along the way. And write an in-depth report of the mission. The final video can be a short presentation such as those that NASA gives to the press about their missions.</li>
    <li><b>Experiment Analysis:</b> If you are able to be in person, we may have the opportunity to do actual experiments and measurements and science. Perform these experiments, take careful data, and document the process. Then write a scientific paper-like report which explains what happened and analysis the results.</li>
    <li><b>Movie Physics:</b> Analyze a movie which heavily features space flight in some way and then make a video which explains what it does right, what it does wrong, and use physics, math, engineering to back it up!</li>
    <li><b>Come up with your own!:</b> Propose your own showcase idea and convince your teachers that it is in-depth enough to be showcase-worthy!</li>
  </ul>
