  <h2>Milestone Objectives</h2>
  <p>While there is quite a bit that you can do in KSP, there are a few important objectives which act as important milestones to more complicated goals. The technology that you will have access to will depend on which milestone you're at, accomplishing a milestone will unlock more powerful technology.
  
  <h2>Space Race!</h2>
  <p>The giant leap in space technology innovation of the 60s is a consequence of what is known as the "Space Race". The major players in the Cold War, the US and the USSR, displayed their technological capabilities by pushing the limits of what humans could do in space. From the first successful orbit (<i><a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputnik_1">Sputnik</a></i> in 1957) to the first successful Moon Landing (<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11">Apollo 11</a></i> in 1969), many feats of rocket design and space flight were accomplished. While a thinly veiled attempt to show off arms capabilities using technology and personell from Nazi research into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V-2_rocket">V-2 Rocketry</a>, such achievements in space flight represent one of the goods to come from US and USSR competition and have inspired multiple generations of scientists, engineers, and space explorers.</p>
  <p>Join our very own Space Race today! Making progress in <i>Kerbal Space Program</i> can be tough, but being the first to accomplish something hard can be very rewarding. To help facilitate this, we will be having our own Space Race here. Check out the long list of possible accomplishments and try to be the first to accomplish some of them. Whenever you accomplish one of these feats, take a screen shot and submit it through this form. We will record the date that you completed it and display the screenshot from the first successful mission. By the end, you should have your own library of accomplishments, and the class will have their collective achievements ready to show off!</p>
  
  <h2>Challenges</h2>
  <p>The Space Race presents many challenges, but there are some challenges we want to highlight and some challenges outside of <i>Kerbal Space Program</i> that we want to present to you.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="KSPChallenges.html">Main <i>Kerbal Space Program</i> Challenges</a></li>
    <li>Rocket Science Challenges</li>
    <li>Space Flight and Orbital Mechanics Science Challenges</li>
    <li>Know your history and media!</li>
    <li>Get your hands dirty!</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Resources</h2>
  <p>These challenges are hard and can involve complicated science, math, game mechanics, other research, or collaboration. Here is a list of resources to help get you started in figuring out some of these things. If you are having trouble starting or get stuck, then reach out to a fellow classmate as sharing a problem can be a sure way to figure it out! And, of course, your teachers are always available to help you think through something.</p>

  <h2>Share!</h2>
  <p>When you complete a difficult challenge or learn something exciting, it can be really great to share your experiences. Write a blog post, make a video, or even a presentation and you can share it with the class. If possible, we can log it here as well.</p>
